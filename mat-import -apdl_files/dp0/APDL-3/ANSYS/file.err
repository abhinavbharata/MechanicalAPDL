 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.516   TIME= 13:24:40
 No constraints have been defined using the D command.                   

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =       2.609   TIME= 13:24:40
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UY   
 degree of freedom of node 4).  Please check for an insufficiently       
 constrained model.                                                      

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.656   TIME= 13:24:40
 The degree of freedom solution is not available.  The PLDISP command is 
 ignored.                                                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       5.719   TIME= 13:26:34
 There are no selected unmeshed lines.  The LATT command is ignored.     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.141   TIME= 13:27:07
 There are no selected unmeshed lines.  The LATT command is ignored.     

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.781   TIME= 13:28:14
 All of the selected lines in the set named on the LMESH command were    
 already meshed.  Clear associated elements before remeshing.            

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =       8.375   TIME= 13:29:11
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UZ   
 degree of freedom of node 4).  Please check for an insufficiently       
 constrained model.                                                      

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.844   TIME= 13:29:55
 The program chosen initial timestep/load-factor is arbitrary.  It is    
 necessary for the user to supply a suitable initial                     
 timestep/load-factor through the NSUB or DELTIM command for             
 convergence and overall efficiency.                                     

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      18.328   TIME= 13:33:37
 There are 24 small equation solver pivot terms (e.g., at the UZ degree  
 of freedom of node 31).  Please check for an insufficiently             
 constrained model.
