 The license is currently in use by another application in this          
 Workbench session such as Mechanical or another Mechanical APDL         
 application.  You must wait until the other application has finished    
 its task (for example meshing) or manually PAUSE the other Mechanical   
 APDL application.  All commands to this application will be ignored     
 until an UNPAUSE command is typed in the Command Window of this         
 application and successfully processed.
